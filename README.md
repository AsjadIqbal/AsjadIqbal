# Asjad Iqbal 
## Backend Engineering | Ranking Systems | Data That Behaves

Senior Software Engineer. Backend-heavy. Data-curious.  
I build systems that survive real traffic, bad data, and worse requirements.

Currently working on large-scale e-commerce platforms and ranking systems, while building product-driven systems and layering intelligence where it actually matters.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Do

- Design and maintain **backend systems** that move millions of records without catching fire
- Build **ranking algorithms** using real user behavior (clicks, traffic groups, decay, outlier control)
- Work deep in the stack: **data → services → APIs → infra**
- Translate vague business ideas into code that can be debugged at 2 AM

- CI pipelines & automation  

**Data & ML (actively leveling up)**

## 🚀 Notable Work

### 🔍 ProductRank V2
A full redesign of product ranking logic for a multi-domain e-commerce platform.

- Traffic-group aware ranking (PLA, CSS, SEO, Affiliate, SEM)
- IQR-based spike control
- Time-decay weighting
- Normalized scoring across domains
- Built for experimentation and A/B testing

Result: rankings that actually reflect user intent, not noise.

### 🌍 New Market Launch
- Sole backend engineer for launching a new comparison-shopping site
- Built reusable infra to reduce future launch effort
- Zero drama. Which is the real achievement.

---

### 🤖 RessyAI (Side Project)
AI voice agent for businesses.

- FastAPI backend
- Real-time voice flows (Twilio + STT/TTS)
- Async systems, auth, CRM logic
- Built from scratch with a small founding team

Still early. Still dangerous. Still fun.

## 🎮 Outside of Code

- Story-driven games (The Witcher 3, RDR2)
- Dark, grounded fiction & anime
- Melodic Techno and Progressive House that just tickles my brain the right way.
- Thinking way too much about systems, even off-work

---

## 📈 What I’m Moving Toward

- Machine Learning & AI systems
- Ranking, relevance, and personalization
- Building products, not just services
- Less glue code, more impact

## 📬 Reach Me

- GitHub: **you’re already here**
- LinkedIn: *you know where to find it*
- Conversations involving systems, data, or good stories are always welcome
